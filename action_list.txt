1.) Sections need timer. When all waves have passed and only "perms" are left, sections need timer for
    when all sections fly away...

2.) Need way to prevent fly-in and fly-out from happening simultaneously.

A.) Need way to synchronize the fly-out direction and fly-in direction.

B.) Need way to wait for fly-out when "all waves" section spawns, so we don't need to fly in? Alternatively we can just always fly in and not notice the fly-in?

3.) Win condition? We need to capture the win condition.

4.) Losing lives when balloons fly offscreen.

5.) Sections transitions with and without "perms" required to have work.



DONE.) Multiple sections per level... We need to come up with a scheme to get this fully working.

DONE.) Require a scrolling text bubble marquee of level sections as they are loaded up... So we can see which sections spawn when...

DONE.) Need to be able to quickly load test_section_x so we can look at them. Perhaps Ctrl + Shift + 1, 2, 3, etc?
