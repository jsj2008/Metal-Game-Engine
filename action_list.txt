B1.) When editor launches game with all permanents, they immediately fly away after landing on screen. There should be some default or programmed-in alive timer...

B2.) Alive timer and kill timer should be part of level section data.

B3.) Alive timer and kill timer need flags for immediate-countdown versus "all waves complete" ? - we need to fully understand how this will work.

A2.) We need to keep track of streaks.

A3.) We need to keep track of particularily good throws. (like 6 balloons with 1 dart)..

A4.) We need to keep track of some achievements!

A5.) We need an "aim arc" which shows where the dart will go.

A6.) We need a game / pause menu.

A7.) We need a main menu.

A8.) We need a level picker screen.

A9.) We need to figure out purchases on Android.

A10.) We need to figure out ads on Android.

A11.) We need to bucket our formations into groups, which are easier to follow.

A12.) We need to separate mixed type sectons, tracer sectons, wave sectons, permanents sectons.

A13.) We need a lighting configuration setup again, the old one is broken.

A14.) We need to get a sky / gradient / background sprite drawing on the 3-D pass..

A15.) We need to get clouds moving around on the 2-D part of the 3-D scene...

A16.) We need an animation of a little bird flting around.

A17.) We need 5 or 6 "ripping plastic" extremely fast 6 frame animations.

A18.) We need a system to organize level sections.

A19.) We need to implement the "turtle" to carry a balloon.

A20.) We need to implement free life balloon.

A21.) We need to implement "prize box".

A22.) We need to add flying cool stars on level-complete animation.

A23.) We need to show a progress bar for how close you are to finishing level.

A24.) We need to start thinking about how you will earn 1, 2, or 3 stars per level.

J.) We need the "wind" to pick up, sway, die down, and change directions in a semi-realistic fashion...

A.) Win condition? We need to capture the win condition.

B.) Losing lives when balloons fly offscreen.

E.) Mock model for "Bomb"

F.) Logic for bomb collisions (Spherical).

DONE.) When brick is hit, it should rumble. The dart should be stuck for ~2 secs and then dissappear...

DONE.) Collisions with "brick head" - the dart should get stuck inside of it.

DONE.) Mock model for "Turtle"

DONE.) Show lives indicators at top-right of screen.

DONE.) Show pause button at the top-left of screen.

DONE.) We need a format to export PACKED 3-D models.

DONE.) Need way to dynamically choose proper image scale + image resolution as device size changes...

DONE.) We need a new BOLD system font. The old one doesn't work anymore.

DONE.) We need a new system font. The old one doesn't work anymore.

DONE.) Convert XML bundle load to use JSON.

DONE.) Spawning mode for "waves only" does not need to animate in..

DONE.) Section enter / leave condition for previous / current section is not synchronized.

DONE.) Section enter / leave should randomly pick between right and left.

DONE.) First section should enter from the TOP, unless it contains no permanents.

DONE.) Sections need timer. When all waves have passed and only "perms" are left, sections need timer for
    when all sections fly away...

DONE.) Need way to synchronize the fly-out direction and fly-in direction.

DONE.) Need way to wait for fly-out when "all waves" section spawns, so we don't need to fly in? Alternatively we can just always fly in and not notice the fly-in?

DONE.) Sections transitions with and without "perms" required to have work.

DONE.) Need way to prevent fly-in and fly-out from happening simultaneously.

DONE.) Multiple sections per level... We need to come up with a scheme to get this fully working.

DONE.) Require a scrolling text bubble marquee of level sections as they are loaded up... So we can see which sections spawn when...

DONE.) Need to be able to quickly load test_section_x so we can look at them. Perhaps Ctrl + Shift + 1, 2, 3, etc?
