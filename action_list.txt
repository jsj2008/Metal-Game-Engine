J.) We need the "wind" to pick up, sway, die down, and change directions in a semi-realistic fashion...

1.A) Need way to dynamically choose proper image scale + image resolution as device size changes...

1.B) We need a new BOLD system font. The old one doesn't work anymore.

3.) When brick is hit, it should rumble. The dart should be stuck for ~2 secs and then dissappear...

1.) Show lives indicators at top-right of screen.

2.) Show pause button at the top-left of screen.

A.) Win condition? We need to capture the win condition.

B.) Losing lives when balloons fly offscreen.

C.) Collisions with "brick head" - the dart should get stuck inside of it.

D.) Mock model for "Turtle"

E.) Mock model for "Bomb"

F.) Logic for bomb collisions (Spherical).


DONE.) We need a new system font. The old one doesn't work anymore.

DONE.) Convert XML bundle load to use JSON.

DONE.) Spawning mode for "waves only" does not need to animate in..

DONE.) Section enter / leave condition for previous / current section is not synchronized.

DONE.) Section enter / leave should randomly pick between right and left.

DONE.) First section should enter from the TOP, unless it contains no permanents.

DONE.) Sections need timer. When all waves have passed and only "perms" are left, sections need timer for
    when all sections fly away...

DONE.) Need way to synchronize the fly-out direction and fly-in direction.

DONE.) Need way to wait for fly-out when "all waves" section spawns, so we don't need to fly in? Alternatively we can just always fly in and not notice the fly-in?

DONE.) Sections transitions with and without "perms" required to have work.

DONE.) Need way to prevent fly-in and fly-out from happening simultaneously.

DONE.) Multiple sections per level... We need to come up with a scheme to get this fully working.

DONE.) Require a scrolling text bubble marquee of level sections as they are loaded up... So we can see which sections spawn when...

DONE.) Need to be able to quickly load test_section_x so we can look at them. Perhaps Ctrl + Shift + 1, 2, 3, etc?
